# 🧠 Caselka Cluster

**Caselka Cluster** is an open-source **digital meta-operator** — a command system for deploying, managing, and scaling AI agents into fully autonomous digital businesses called **clusters**.

> Caselka doesn't build products. It builds infrastructures that build businesses.

## 🚀 What is Caselka?

Caselka is designed for **technical founders, solo operators, and future meta-operators** who want to orchestrate AI-powered systems — not just workflows.

A **Cluster** is a living, modular business unit.  
It consists of AI agents that:
- Monitor trends  
- Generate outputs  
- Communicate with users or leads  
- Execute actions  
- Log feedback and self-adapt  

Each agent is deployed and managed via Caselka's hybrid interface — **CLI + Web UI**.
